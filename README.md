# General-Purpose Sentiment Analysis using Hybrid Neural Networks ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¬
 
## Overview
General-Purpose Sentiment Analysis is a deep learning project aimed at analyzing and classifying sentiment in text data across various domains. The project leverages a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to provide accurate sentiment predictions for a wide range of applications.

## Methodology
The project adopts a hybrid approach, utilizing CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing sequential dependencies in the text data. By training the model on a diverse dataset comprising GoEmotions and DailyDialog, it achieves robust sentiment analysis capabilities across different emotional nuances.

## Features
- Multi-class sentiment classification across 6 emotions including happy, sad, fear, anger, surprise and neutral.
- Comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline ensuring clean and standardized input data.
- Strategic handling of class imbalance to optimize model generalization.
- Versatile model architecture adaptable to various text data domains and applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-hybrid.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Train the model using the provided dataset or your custom data.

## Usage
1. Prepare your text data by following the provided preprocessing guidelines.
2. Train the sentiment analysis model using the prepared dataset.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
4. Deploy the trained model in your desired application or environment for sentiment analysis tasks.
